            <h3 style="margin-top: 3%"> Advance Payment </h3>
            <p>  Upon processing and verification of your order, you will receive an order confirmation from us via email with our bank information and all of the details required for the transfer. Once the payment has been received, the order will be shipped. Please note that due to bank processing times, it may take up to 3 business days to complete the transfer of the amount onto our account. For very urgent orders we do not recommend the advance payment method because of the time required for the bank to process the transfer. The advance payment method is not available for orders shipping via express delivery. Please note that we will automatically cancel the order after a period of 10 days of non-payment.

                An advance payment, or simply an advance, is the part of a contractually due sum that is paid or received in advance for goods or services, while the balance included in the invoice will only follow the delivery. </p>
            <h3> PayPal </h3>
            <p>  After processing your order you will be redirected to your PayPal account. You will then grant us permission to debit the amount to be paid for the order. Only shortly before shipping of the ordered items, will the invoice amount actually be debited from your PayPal account. PayPal reserves the right to subsequently propose alternative payment methods in the case of very large sums or if the PayPal credit limit has been exceeded. For further information on payments via PayPal please click on the PayPal logo. </p>
            <h3> Cash on Delivery </h3>
            <p> The invoice amount is paid upon delivery directly to the delivery person. Items in stock at the time of the order will be shipped on the same business day.  </p>
            <h3> Pay now </h3>
            <p>  After your order has been processed you will be linked to the payment service provider Sofort GmbH (A Klarna Group Company) in order to complete the transfer via online banking through the PIN/TAN process. Compared to advanced payment (by bank transfer), you have the advantage that the payment process using "Pay now." follows directly after the purchase order has been placed. The payment details will be transferred automatically from the online shop. Furthermore, we can process and deliver your order faster thanks to the real-time transaction notification.
                This payment method is available for customers with bank accounts in the following countries: Belgium, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Austria, Poland and Switzerland. </p>
            <h3> Credit Card </h3>
            <p>  The total amount payable of your order will initially only be reserved on your credit card. Once the order has been shipped will the amount actually be debited from your account â€“ so that in the event that an item is not actually available, no credit card will be unnecessarily charged. </p>
